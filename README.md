# About The Project
  <p align = "center">
    <p>
     In our day to day lives, we have multiple tasks to complete everyday. Sometimes, in all the hassle we forget the most-important tasks to be done.
     So here's an app, made by me, to manage your daily todos and make it easy for you to organise your tasks for the day. 
     This todo-app is user-friendly and attractive at the same time.
